# Energy Expenditure Estimation Using Acceleration Data

## Project Overview
This research proposes a method to estimate energy expenditure during physical activities by analyzing acceleration data collected from the Axivity AX3 bracelet. Our study focuses on extracting burned energy measurements in Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) units during walking and running at different speeds.
Research Methodology

Conducted experiments using 6 different walking and running speeds
Utilized acceleration data from the Axivity AX3 sensor
Applied preprocessing techniques
Developed a linear regression model to extrapolate energy expenditure

## Key Findings

Successfully created a predictive model for caloric expenditure
Achieved reliable results primarily for walking speeds above 4 kilometers per hour
Identified potential limitations in the current model:

Limited data for low walking speeds
Variations in arm movement between walking and running
Research based on data from a single subject



## Technologies

Python: Data analysis and model development
Axivity AX3 Sensor: Acceleration data collection

## Research Directions

Expand dataset with more subjects
Refine model accuracy for lower walking speeds
Improve calculation methods for different movement patterns
